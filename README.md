# Projects I'd Like To Do

[![forthebadge](http://forthebadge.com/images/badges/fuck-it-ship-it.svg)](http://forthebadge.com)
A little to-do list of projects I'd like to try doing some day. 


* Email Secretary: A serverless email app which lets you forward recruiter emails to an address to send an automated response back as yourself. The content of the email can change based on what "bin" you want to put it in (not looking / wrong job spec / etc)

* Engaged: An IoT button for the office toilet which tells you if someone is in or not.

* Personal website/app: A website which deploys my love of physical UIs on blog posts, code samples and more random ramblings from myself.

* A mobile/social game which lets you start your own game studio

* Something that uses web components

* My own lodash/underscore like library, that works out of the box with es6 modules without jumping through hoops

* A loading bar which fills it's area like liquid in a jug, filling up as it gets full and tilting with device orientation.
